# Crypto - all the way down

## Terms

### Crypto Community

**A community** is a small or large social group of actors who have something in common, such as norms, rules and values.

That definition is a bit different from “a Society”: **A society** is a group of people involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations.

**A crypto-community** can be defined as a group of actors that own a specific crypto-asset \(i.e. token\). No any other actions other than holding are required to be a member of a community. Crypto-community member can be a living person or an automatic entity \(robot, smart contract, DAO, etc\).

### **Protocol \(Cryptoeconomic Protocol\)**

When discussing blockchains, the term “[protocol](https://blog.0xproject.com/the-difference-between-app-coins-and-protocol-tokens-7281a428348c)” is typically used to refer to the set of cryptoeconomic rules that maintain distributed consensus across a peer-to-peer network. In this sense of the term, there is one protocol per blockchain and one native token per protocol \(with a few exceptions\). However, blockchain consensus isn’t the only use case for cryptoeconomic protocols.

### \*\*\*\*[**Information Asymmetry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry)\*\*\*\*

In contract theory and economics, information asymmetry deals with the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other.

### \*\*\*\*[**Self-sustaining System**](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7)\*\*\*\*

A system is self-sustaining if it would continue to function normally in the indefinite absence of its creators.

### \*\*\*\*[**Public utility System**](https://medium.com/gitcoin/why-gitcoin-didnt-launch-with-a-token-f24af0b54ded)\*\*\*\*

A system is a public utility if it is permissionless, rent-free, and do something useful.

### \*\*\*\*[**Peak predators of capitalism**](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7)\*\*\*\*

A peak predator of capitalism is a system which produces some useful output at the lowest possible marginal cost.

### \*\*\*\*[**Tragedy of the Commons**](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/funding-the-evolution-of-blockchains-87d160988481)\*\*\*\*

The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.  
  
“Ethereum is starting to suffer from a tragedy of the commons problem: while lots of people own ETH and would benefit from Ethereum improving, the economic reward for any single individual improving it is low.”

### \*\*\*\*[**Collusion**](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)\*\*\*\*

**Collusion is difficult to define; perhaps the only truly valid way to put it is to simply say that collusion is “coordination that we don’t like”.**

### \*\*\*\*[**Complexity of value**](https://medium.com/@homakov/make-ethereum-blockchain-again-ef73c5b86582)\*\*\*\*

Complexity of value is the thesis that human values have high [Kolmogorov complexity](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity); that our preferences, the things we care about, cannot be summed by a few simple rules, or compressed.  
  
As an example of “break the rules”, Vitalik wrote:

“Let me make another thing clear: TheDAO should have been reverted no matter what. That we can agree about. No matter what % of shareholders approved fixing the TheDAO hack, it would be the right thing to do.

Blockchains have complex value, while we say the code should work as it is written, no one would reject a hard fork if suddenly there’s a vulnerability that allows spending from any address.”  
  
“Contributors value things beyond money: the intellectual pursuit, the status and camaraderie it brings within their community, and the mission of a project”

### \*\*\*\*[**Local Community Currency/Community Currency?**](https://medium.com/@joshuadavis31/bancor-can-change-crowdfunding-3b71610c8988)\*\*\*\*

“Local currency \(see Bancor’s market maker, smart token\) represents weight in the community. When you burn local currency you are in effect capitalizing the pool and subsidizing everyone's future claims.”

“The first time I read the Bancor white paper I felt that the concept of price discovery for smart tokens was a very important tool to create community currencies. There has always been a need for a simple solution to the price discovery problem for illiquid assets in crypto. It had occurred to me previously that perhaps a smart contract could facilitate the other side of a trade. Normally a small community currency would be illiquid on an exchange. This solution would provide a community currency with desperately needed liquidity. The problem with providing community currencies liquidity is that its difficult to figure out what the price for a community currency is if no one is trading it. The solution of finding an automated way whereby price is determined is a remarkable discovery.

### \*\*\*\*[**Network Effect**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp)\*\*\*\*

A network effect \(also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale\) is the positive effect that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.
