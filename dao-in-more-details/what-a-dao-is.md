# What a DAO is?

## What is a “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” \(DAO\)?

**A human organization** can be defined as combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals.

**A decentralized organization \(DO\)** takes the same concept of an organization, and decentralizes it. Instead of a hierarchical structure managed by a set of humans interacting in person and controlling property via the legal system, a decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol.

**A decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\)** is an entity that lives "on the internet" and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot do.

Another definition of DAO [is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oghfq1VFfGvScxzNWD14vNg_fEAC8HVrfVVVU3Al-gA/edit): **a decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\)** is an entity that exists in multiple redundant locations, has sovereign control over internal capital \(assets\), and prohibits unintended modifications of its assets or mechanisms. A decentralized autonomous organization performs the role of manager of human behavior within an organization.

#### DAO often consists of:

1. Assets: internal currency, tokens, etc;
2. Actors: curators, moderators, token holders, robots, smart contracts, etc;
3. Rules of governance/protocol: permissions, business logic, etc.
