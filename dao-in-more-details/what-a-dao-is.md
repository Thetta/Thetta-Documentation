# What a DAO is

## What is a “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” \(DAO\)?

A human organization can be defined as combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals.

**A decentralized organization \(DO\)** takes the same concept of a human organization, and decentralizes it. Instead of a hierarchical structure managed by a set of humans interacting in person and controlling property via the legal system, a decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol.

**A decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\)** is an entity that lives "on the internet" and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automation itself cannot do.

Another definition of DAO [is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oghfq1VFfGvScxzNWD14vNg_fEAC8HVrfVVVU3Al-gA/edit): **a decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\)** is an entity that exists in multiple redundant locations, has sovereign control over internal capital \(assets\), and prohibits unintended modifications of its assets or mechanisms. A decentralized autonomous organization performs the role of manager of human behaviour within an organization.

#### DAO often consists of:

1. Assets: internal currency, tokens, etc;
2. Actors: curators, moderators, token holders, robots, smart contracts, etc;
3. Rules of governance/protocol: permissions, business logic, etc.

### DO vs DAO

The obvious difference between a DO and a DAO, and the one inherent in the language, is the word “autonomous”; that is, in a DO the humans are the ones making the decisions, and a DAO is something that, _in some fashion_, makes decisions for itself.    
  
In a DAO collusion attacks are treated as a bug, whereas in a DO they are a feature.
