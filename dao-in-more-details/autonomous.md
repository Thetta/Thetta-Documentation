# Autonomous?

## Definition \(strong\) of an "Autonomous"

This definition is widely used in the AI/self-driving cars industry:

"The Level 5 autonomous application should make the decision based on its own intelligence and self-improve from the outcomes of the decisions that it made.

**DAO is supposed to be full autonomous, which has Level 5 automation. No human created applications reach the "autonomous" level yet.**

DApp does not mention the level of automation. All the examples it gave are the automated software since there is no autonomous software yet. All existing blockchains based DApps including Bitcoin just automate the pre-coded business logic. Vitalik mentioned the DAO as the holy grail since no one yet got there even some may have called themselves TheDAO". 

In this sense we either:

1. Should remove the "autonomous" from the DAO acronym;
2. Should change the "autonomous" to something different, like "adaptive";
3. Should treat all "DAO" projects as DOs, but not DAOs \(even "TheDAO"\);
4. Should use another acronym/term like ["AI DAO"](https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ai-daos-and-three-paths-to-get-there-cfa0a4cc37b8). 

## Definition \(weak\) of an "Autonomous"

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy) has this definition of an "autonomous organization": 

> "Autonomous organizations are independent or self-governing."

Speaking about DAOs and crypto, we are going to use this definition instead of a stronger definition of an "autonomous" \(see above\). In this sense, Bitcoin is "autonomous" and TheDAO is "autonomous" too. 

## Resume. Why "Autonomous"?

Autonomous systems often have better decision making: easier, done faster and more verifiable and can better adapt to changes.
