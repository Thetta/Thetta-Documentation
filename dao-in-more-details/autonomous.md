# Autonomous

## Definition of "Autonomous" \(AI industry\)

{% embed url="https://medium.com/swlh/whats-the-difference-between-dapp-idapp-and-dao-and-why-they-are-the-future-of-blockchain-52758f50474e" %}

This definition is widely used in the AI/self-driving cars industry:

"The Level 5 autonomous application should make the decision based on its own intelligence and self-improve from the outcomes of the decisions that it made.

**DAO is supposed to be full autonomous, which has Level 5 automation. No human created applications reach the "autonomous"¬ù level yet.**

DApp does not mention the level of automation. All the examples it gave are the automated software since there is no autonomous software yet. All existing blockchains based DApps including Bitcoin just automate the pre-coded business logic. Vitalik mentioned the DAO as the holy grail since no one yet got there even some may have called themselves TheDAO". 

In this sense we either:

1. Should remove the "autonomous" from the DAO acronym;
2. Should change the "autonomous" to something different, like "adaptive";
3. Should treat all "DAO" projects as DOs, but not DAOs \(even "TheDAO"\);
4. Should use another acronym/term like ["AI DAO"](https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ai-daos-and-three-paths-to-get-there-cfa0a4cc37b8). 

## Definition of "Autonomous" \(by Thetta\)

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy): "Autonomous organizations are independent or self-governing". In this sense USA is an autonomous organization. This definition is too broad, so we are going to use a stronger definition:

{% hint style="success" %}
Synthetic definition by Thetta: **"A system is Autononomous if it is Automated and Independent"**
{% endhint %}

### **What is Automated?**

{% hint style="success" %}
Synthetic definition by Thetta: **"A system is Automated if SOME decisions are made automatically \(by code, smart contracts, business logic, etc\)"**
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/automated2.png)

### **What is Independent?**

{% hint style="success" %}
Synthetic definition by Thetta \(weak\): **"A system is Independent in the particular environment - if it MOSTLY does NOT obey rules of the system located on the same or higher level"**
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/a1.png)

1. Apple Inc. obeys rules of Legal system. But Legal system does not obey rules of Apple Inc.; 
2. Apple Inc. obeys rules of Legal system **and** USA **and** United Nations.

![](../.gitbook/assets/a2%20%281%29.png)

1. The Mobile dept. obeys rules of Apple Inc. **and** Legal system **and** USA **and** World **and** United Nations.  But Mobile dept. is NOT independent because it obeys rules of the Design dept. \(same level\) too; 
2. The Design dept. obeys rules of Apple Inc. **and** Legal system **and** USA **and** World **and** United Nations. But Design dept. is NOT independent because it obeys rules of Tim Cook \(higher level\) too; 
3. Tim Cook obeys rules of Apple Inc. **and** Legal system **and** USA **and** World **and** United Nations. But Tim Cook DOES NOT obey rules of a Design dept. and there is no one above him! That's why he is independent.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Still, in reality there is no even a single system that is trully independent \(in this sense\). Even Tim Cook has some formal/informal input from the same level \(CEOs of Samsung, chip manufacturers, etc\) and from the level above \(Apple investors\).

Definition above is "weak" because in order to be "independent" one should not be a 100% independent.

</table>## Resume. Why "Autonomous"?

Autonomous systems often have better decision making: easier, done faster and more verifiable and can better adapt to changes.
