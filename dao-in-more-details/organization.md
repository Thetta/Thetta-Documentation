# Organization

## Definition of an "Organization"

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization): "An organization is an entity comprising multiple people, such as an institution or an association, that has a collective goal and is linked to an external environment."

{% hint style="success" %}
Synthetic definition by Thetta: **"An organization is an entity that is comprised of multiple actors \(humans, smart contracts, etc\) with clear governance rules, incentives and internal capital.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Example: "TheDAO" as an organization \(in this sense\) consists of:

1. Actors - token holders and curators
2. Clear governance rules and incentives - deployed code
3. Internal capital - tokens, ETH \(profit and funds\)

What is not included:

1. Domain and web site - **DaoHub.org** \(asset, but not an internal capital\)
2. Legal entity - **DAO.Link** company \(asset, but not an internal capital\)
3. Team

\(TODO\) We are not sure if these entities should be included or not:

1. Source code
2. Idea
{% endhint %}
