# What Thetta DAO Framework is?

### Thetta DAO Framework features these subsystems

1. Permission manager/Roles;
2. Token manager;
3. Governance subsystem \(proposals, votings, etc\);
4. Reputation subsystem;
5. Dispute Resolution subsystem;
6. Moneyflow subsystem;
7. ICO subsystem.

### But what about the Runtime support?

#### ~~Runtime support:~~

1. ~~**Factories;**~~
2. ~~**Contract upgradeability;**~~
3. ~~**Contract registry;**~~
4. ~~**Library support: code &lt;-&gt; storage.**~~

Thetta is NOT A "smart contracts operating system \(OS\)".   
We do not want to end up building a "Windows" with Registry, DLL/EXE loader, Cache and Network layer.   
  
Instead, Thetta is a small and easy-to-use tool for developers.
