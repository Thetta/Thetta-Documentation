# 2 - Splitters

TODO - add description of the idea   
  
TODO - Splitter is a entity that receives ETHer and splits it into multiple destinations.

{% hint style="info" %}
You SHOULD NOT send more ETH than needed to the splitter! It will throw exception.
{% endhint %}



## 1. **Top-down splitter**

In a top-down splitter money are flowing from the top to bottom. That is why the order is very important.

TODO - add code \(same as on pic\)

## **2. Unsorted splitter**

In unsorted splitter there is no difference how children are ordered, i.e. you can swap any elements and the result will still stay the same.
