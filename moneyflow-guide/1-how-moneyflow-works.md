# 1 - How moneyflow works

## What is a Moneyflow?

This subsystem can be utilized by any DAO. But it is completely optional. Use this subsystem to process funds, i.e. pay salaries, manage funds, etc.  


There are 3 types of MoneyFlow elements that you can use:

1. Source - just an ordinary Ethereum account or a smart contract that is the source of the money;
2. Splitter - has many outputs \(children\), automatically splits incoming funds;
3. Destination - thatâ€™s where money finally arrive. Destination has no children;
4. Table - ...

### How does MoneyFlow work?
