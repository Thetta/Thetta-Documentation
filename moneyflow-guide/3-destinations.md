# 3 - Destinations

There are two types of destinations: funds and expenses.

## 1. Funds

1. Capped or Uncapped Uncapped collects any amount of funds Capped collects funds until some amount is reached.
2. Pull model or Push model Currently all Thetta funds have “pull model”, i.e. when you need to call some method to get money out of it.
3. Untokenized or Tokenized Currently all Thetta funds are “untokenized”. Tokenized fund means that you need tokens in order to pull money out of it \(rewards subsystem\).
